			"description": "The Cougar is a family of MRAP vehicles originally developed by Force Protection (USA/UK) in the early 2000s. Available in 4×4 (Cougar H) and 6×6 (Cougar HE) versions, it features a V-hull to deflect blasts and has proven highly survivable against mines/IEDs (Crew capsule often intact after 7 kg mine). A Cougar 4×4 carries 6 (2+4) and weighs ~17 tons, with speed ~105 km/h and range ~675 km. Armed with a roof gun (typically 7.62 or 12.7 mm), Cougars were widely used by US, UK (as Mastiff), and others in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have saved lives in countless roadside bomb attacks, and dozens have been donated to Ukraine in 2022.",

			"description": "The D-20 is a towed 152 mm gun-howitzer developed by the Soviet Union in the 1950s. It has a 152 mm L/28 barrel firing HE out to ~17.4 km (21 km with RAP). The D-20 requires a 8–10 man crew and can sustain ~5 rpm. It served as a versatile field gun and howitzer for Soviet and allied forces, playing roles in the Vietnam War and Middle East wars of the 20th century. The D-20 has no protection for crew, and relies on trucks for mobility. Although largely replaced by 2S3 SPHs and later systems, D-20s are still found in some arsenals (e.g. Syria, North Korea) and have even been seen in use in the 2022 Ukraine conflict (by militias), given their availability and robust design.",

The D-30 fires 122 mm shells to ~15.4 km and up to ~21 km with rocket-assisted projectiles. It has a high rate of fire (up to 8 rpm short burst, 4 rpm sustained) and requires a 6–8 person crew. Weighing 3.2 tons, it can be towed by a truck and is fully manual in operation. The D-30 has been extremely widely used (over 50 countries), from Soviet campaigns in Afghanistan to recent conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, due to its reliability and ample ammunition supply. However, its shorter range and lighter shell make it less potent than 155 mm systems.",

The Uragan launcher is lightly armored and relies on mobility and shoot-and-scoot tactics. It was employed by Soviet forces in Afghanistan and by various countries afterward.

Each rocket carries a 100+ kg warhead (HE fragmentation or submunitions); newer rockets can be GPS-guided for accuracy. A full 12-rocket salvo can blanket a square kilometer with lethal blasts. The system is unarmored but highly mobile (~60 km/h on road, ~850 km range). Smerch was introduced in 1989 and used by Russia, Ukraine, India and others. In Ukraine (2022), Smerch rockets have been used for long-range strikes, causing significant destruction and psychological effect due to their powerful impact.",
